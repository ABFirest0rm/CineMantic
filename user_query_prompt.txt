Rewrite it into the "Enriched Overview Style" following the same rules used to build the databases.

1. Enriched Overview Style
This should follow these exact rules:
- A natural rephrasing of the overview only, in the style of TMDB overviews.
- Do NOT add mood descriptors, keywords, or any extra details not in the overview.
- No hallucinations.
- Second sentence must begin with: "Released in the {{period}},"

📌 Period Rules (must match database normalization):
- Years ending in 0–3 → "early {{decade}}s" (e.g., 1970–1973 → "early 1970s")
- Years ending in 4–6 → "mid {{decade}}s" (e.g., 1974–1976 → "mid 1970s")
- Years ending in 7–9 → "late {{decade}}s" (e.g., 1977–1979 → "late 1970s")
- If the year is unknown → "unknown period"
- Never output the raw year (like 1978 or 2002). Always use normalized early/mid/late decades.

After the period:
- Mention the genres in natural form (e.g., "this horror mystery").
- Follow with a natural description of the keywords.
- Do NOT use boilerplate phrases like "This is a ..." or "The movie is described as ...".
- Do NOT mention the exact year.

Keyword rewriting rules:
- Use all keywords provided, but merge duplicates (e.g., “sadism” + “sadist” → “sadism”).
- Join them in natural language instead of a raw list, e.g.:
  "surreal and tense with a haunted house and a demon"
  instead of "surreal, tense, haunted house, demon".
- Group related items logically (e.g., weapons together, locations together, moods together).
- Do not add new details or hallucinate.
- Do not output brackets, bullet points, or numbered lists.

Formatting rules:
- Output must be exactly two sentences, in one paragraph.
- No extra commentary, no markdown, no explanations.
